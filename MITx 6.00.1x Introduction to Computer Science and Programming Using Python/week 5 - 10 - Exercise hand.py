Week 5: Object Oriented Programming   10. An Extended Example   Exercise: hand

n this problem, you'll be asked to read through an object-oriented 
implementation of the hand from the word game problem of Problem Set 4. 
You'll then be asked to implement one of its methods. Note that the 
implementation of the object-oriented version of the hand is a bit different 
than how we did things with the functional implementation; pay close attention 
to doc strings and read through the implementation carefully.

To begin: Download hand.py and read through the file. Be sure to understand
what's going on in the file. Make a few instances of the Hand class, and 
play around with the existing methods.

When you have completed reading through the file, implement the update method.

Paste the entire Hand class in the box below.

The __str__ method is this:
